PROBLEM STATEMENT : To predict wether a customer purchases a certain item based on their age and salary

Algorithm used : Logistic Regression

Model Accuracy : 95%

workflow :
gather the data
check essential features of the data, like shape, column, describe, etc
check the presence of any missing values

it was observed that there exists a wide scale gap between age and salary, hence we need to bring it to a common scale.
In order to do the same, we had 2 methods to choose from - Normalisation and standardisation
We chose Normalisation(x-xmax/xmin-xmax) instead of standardisation(x-mean/std dev)
we applied and transformed the 2 parameters

we went for univariate visualisations
splitting,training the algorithm
testing
validating(confusion matrix)
checking the accuracy(1-wrong predictions/total samples)
prediction
